New South Wales,2021,247,ACTIVATED Public Spaces,"What makes a public space vibrant, walkable, and encourages people to dwell longer at different times of the day or night, and throughout the year? 
","### The Challenge:

This problem statement seeks to find solutions that support our **‘ACTIVATED’** public spaces approach. We are interested in understanding what makes a public space vibrant, walkable, and what encourages people to dwell longer in a given space. Also, in understanding the volume and movement of people in different spaces, particularly using walking (inclusive of wheelchairs or other mobility aids) as their primary travel mode. What does this mean for design or programming public spaces at different times of the day and night, and throughout the year? 

Broadly, activation can be described as, the level of human activity in public spaces including the number of people walking, the number of people spending time and the diversity of people present. Activation or liveliness in public spaces may, with appropriate pre-conditions, happen spontaneously and among people who may have little conscious regard for their physical surroundings. Conversely, other public spaces require invitations and enticements to attract a human dimension. How public spaces are programmed, designed, and managed, therefore, becomes of critical importance. 


### Background:

Quality green, open and public spaces are important to everyone. They are our free and publicly accessible parks, gardens and sports fields, walkable shady streets, libraries, museums and galleries, which form the heart of our communities. Our public spaces make life more welcoming and accessible. They delight and connect people. They support our health and well-being, environmental resilience and prosperous local economies. They’re at the heart of everyday life.

Public spaces are all places **publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all for free**. They include our **open spaces, public facilities (e.g. libraries, galleries, museums) and streets**. The quality of public space is a combination of its **physical form**, the **activities** that occur in the place and the **meaning** people associate with the place. 

The NSW Premier’s Priority Greener Public Spaces (the Priority) is to *increase the proportion of homes in urban areas within 10 minutes’ walk of quality green, open and public space by 10 percent by 2023*. To monitor the impact of the Priority we measure an increase in homes in urban areas that have improved access within 10 minutes’ walk (800m walking catchment) of a new or improved public space.  

To achieve the Priority, we are taking a “more, better, activated” approach, along with emphasising the resilience of public space as playing a key role in the “road to recovery” from recent disasters and the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

• MORE: identifying areas with lower access to public space, the Priority will target strategies that provide access to new quality public spaces in these areas
• BETTER: identifying areas with high access to public space, the Priority will target strategies that improve quality of public spaces in these areas 
• **ACTIVATED:** in all areas, the Priority will target strategies that increase activation 
• ROAD TO RECOVERY: Since 2019 we have also focused our work on the importance of public spaces in the resilience of communities to disasters such as bushfires, floods and the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Evaluation Tool for Public Space and Public Life, is the first resource in the new online Great Public Spaces Toolkit. It is a user-friendly resource that allows anyone to assess the quality of public spaces, its positive attributes, as well as areas for improvement. The NSW Public Spaces Charter is another key resource. The Charter, currently in draft form, can be used to guide planning, design, management and activation of public space. The Charter will be a resource for individuals, organisations and agencies responsible for public space.

New Zealand,2021,275,Being More Sustainable: Travelling using the most sustainable route,"We all know the effect on climate change from CO2 emissions. How can we translate this into tangible action made by a citizen, that they know is making a collective impact?
","
Transportation is a high CO2 emissions source. How can you assist a citizen to travel across the city, using the most sustainable route?

Everyone is different and have varying constraints in their lives, eg. a family of four cannot scooter, a single traveller has more flexibility. We need to take this into account.

Through this challenge, the council wants to encourage “Active Citizenship” under the greater theme of “Conscious choices”. This will help facilitate the citizen to understand the total cost of activity. Vote with your travel habits!

We want you to build a solution that assists a citizen when deciding how to travel from one point to another in the most sustainable way.

### Additional Information: 

Below are examples of how you might wish to approach this challenge. Please use this as an example only and not as guidance.

**For example:**

Option 1: Drive from A to B, for vehicle type C = D CO2 tonnes and cost you $E, F hrs in time, needing G Trees planted to offset the trip

Option 2: Walk from A to Station B, Take bus C, Stop at Station D, grab a lime scooter to E = F CO2 tonnes, cost you $G, H hrs in time, needing I Trees planted to offset the trip

1. Provide an application that will ask the user for start and end locations in the city, provide them choices of transportation and display the impact of this choice in:

• CO2, Money, Time, Trees
• Researched assumptions for CO2 emissions by vehicle type

2. Provide a feature to the help citizen’s constraints: minimize CO2, cost, time, transport changes

3. Connect to a service that makes it easy to Buy, Plant a tree to offset the trip

4. Create a social feature out of Tree currency, compete against friends, reach different levels of trees planted / cost game levels towards zero CO2 for their family; example: https://www.forestapp.cc/

5. Let the citizen know the location of their trees planted

6. A feature that optimizes routes to take the next electric bus

New South Wales,2021,248,BETTER Public Spaces,"How do we help ensure everyone feels welcome and safe in public spaces (day and night) regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or identity?","### The Challenge:

This problem statement seeks to find solutions that support our **‘BETTER’** public spaces approach, specifically how we can ensure everyone feels welcome and safe in public spaces (day and night) regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or identity.   Not everyone in NSW can access and use public space in the same way. For example, research indicates that women are more likely to feel unwelcome and unsafe in public spaces than men, including when walking alone at night. 

As a part of the Places to Love program partnership between the Department and Penrith City Council, a Womens Night Walk was run in the Kingswood area. Seven key themes from the participants were identified to improve safety 1. Improve Lighting, 2. Create a seamless walking experience, 3. Make our open spaces a place to stay for the whole family, 4. Build on the sense of community, 5. Make our spaces visually attractive, 6. Green and breathable places, and 7. Address perceptions of safety. 

In 2020 the Department’s ‘Public spaces during COVID-19’ survey aimed to provide the NSW Government with insight into the changing uses of public spaces as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. From 4,777 survey responses and online map comments, the following theme on safety in public spaces was a priority: Around 25% of comments were about safety in public spaces. The feedback suggests local communities have a good understanding of what their neighbourhoods need to be safe. This includes lower vehicle speed limits and other steps to make public spaces more inclusive and enjoyable for all.

New Zealand,2021,262,Digital Future – New Zealand,"How can New Zealand lead its effort to build Digital Skills, Education and Employment?
","The global health crisis has accelerated digitalisation by at least a decade. For New Zealand to be a world leading digital economy, there’s a need to build digital technology skills, develop a tech start-up ecosystem that will create more employment opportunities in the economy. 

We want you to re-imagine learning and skills programs that will lead to a thriving digital start-up ecosystem in New Zealand. While technology is changing our lives for the better, it’s also augmenting how we work, replacing repetitive tasks performed by humans and allowing people the opportunity to work in areas that leverage creative and cognitive skills. 

According to research from NZTech, the global health crisis has pushed New Zealand’s digital skills shortage to crisis point. The organisation’s digital skill survey found that the pandemic has caused a severe skills shortage of digital skills in New Zealand and there could be as many as 10,000 open roles that companies are struggling to fill. 

For New Zealand to be a world leading digital economy it’s crucial for it to re-imagine its approach to education, learning and employment that will accelerate digital skills. An important area to consider while working on this challenge is the need to build a culture that encourages New Zealanders to embrace digital skills. 

•	How can we enable workers today and tomorrow possess the skills to succeed in our future? 
•	How can we prepare future students for the jobs of tomorrow? 
•	How can we identify and encourage the next generation of technologists who may need help to realise those future opportunities? 

Everything from business operations to consumer choices to employment opportunities have changed due to the global health crisis. The impact of digital skills shortage in our labour market is significantly impacting our country’s economic output. How can we build net-new talent and build a sustainable ecosystem of job creation via New Zealand digital start-up and enable talent that can support such an ecosystem.

","Much established population data is backward looking, and only available well after the events that may alter it. Whilst, under ‘normal’ conditions, there is inertia in much population change; the last two years have demonstrated that sizable shocks can occur.

What does a shock, such as the COVID-19 pandemic mean for projecting future population change. Can pre-existing trends be expected to reoccur or can ‘early-warning’ signals of emerging trends be identified while they are still developing?

**More information:**

We know the 2021 Census is going to be a snapshot of a very turbulent time and alternative data is needed to better identify contemporary population change (both growth and decline). 

The modelling that the population team does is around where people live and the communities they live in. Household sizes are changing all the time, but how will a shock such as the COVID-19 pandemic influence household size. For instance, has the pandemic resulted in more young people who have come from regional areas to metropolitan areas for study or work, move back home for a cheaper and safer lifestyle. If this is occurring, what impact does this have on household sizes, are they getting bigger? What does this mean for infrastructure and service delivery in regional communities?

Considering the uncertainty around the impacts of the pandemic and what this means for the future, how can we automate and produce a synthetic resource to be able to track better data? Has COVID-19 reshaped the population in NSW?

Australia,2021,236,Exploring the National Skills Commission’s Australian Skills Classification,"How can the general public learn about and be encouraged to interact with the Australian Skills Classification to identify skills within occupations, identify their own skillsets and identify transferability to other occupations of interest?","The challenge involves exploring how the Australian Skills Classification can be made useful to the general public (including young people, job seekers and those looking for job transitions) for use in identifying existing skill and pathways of transition to occupations of interest.

<br>
# The Australian Skills Classification
<br>

The National Skills Commission (NSC) was established in July 2020, under the National Skills Commissioner Act 2020 and is supported by the Department of Education, Skills and Employment. 

The Australian Skills Classification (the Classification) was released by the NSC as a beta in March 2021. The Classification is a brand new way of categorising skills, and it systematically sets out a structure for and relationships between skills within occupations and across the labour market. 

The Classification currently provides occupation profiles outlining the core competencies, technology tools, and specialist tasks for 600 occupations. The Classification identifies: 
• 10 core competencies: common skills used in all occupations 
• 88 technology tools: a technology, such as software or hardware, associated with a job
• 1925 specialist tasks: detailed work activities required within a job.

The new way of categorising skills and its relationship with occupations can be illustrated in the following example. Sales Assistants is the largest employing occupation in Australia. This occupation requires skills in customer service, processing sales, maintaining product knowledge and monitoring inventories. The Classification allows users to see which other occupations also require these skills. For instance 13 other occupations also perform the task of “Advise customers on the use of goods or services”, including Landscape Architects and ICT Sales Professionals. Sales Assistants also have high competency levels for teamwork and use a variety of software and hardware in their roles, all of which can be seen in the Classification profile for this occupation. 

While training packages and industry organisations have defined certain skill sets for particular occupations, there has been a lack of a broader framework to identify and consistently measure and align skills. Instead, education levels, qualifications and occupations have been used as proxies for skill levels. While skills in individual occupations, qualifications are recognised, there has been a lack of understanding of how bundles of skills combine within occupations and can be transferable across different roles in the labour market.

By categorising skills, and linking them to occupations, the Australian Skills Classification helps people such as job seekers and school leavers make informed decisions about jobs and career choices.

<br>
# The Challenge
<br>

Since the beta launch in March, the current users of the Skills Classification have mainly been industry associations and leaders, training and qualification providers, and policy makers and researchers. The challenge is now to explore how the Skills Classification can be made useful to the general public (including young people, job seekers and those looking for job transitions) for use in identifying existing skills and pathways of transition to occupations of interest. 

This challenge could involve developing a new interface, for example that is better targeted to these demographics with new ways of navigating or other functionality that allows the general public to explore and becoming familiar with using the Classification.

New South Wales,2021,249,Getting parking right: matching car parking rates to accessibility,"How can we make a difference by making ‘accessibility’ measurable?
","We are looking for a way to measure ‘accessibility’ to help us set car parking rates for new development that are more responsive to locational context. 

We want to understand how people use public and active transport, and emerging transport solutions like car share, to meet their transport needs – and where on-site car parking requirements can be reduced as a result.

### Background:

Land use planners are keen to ensure that requirements for car parking provision by new development are appropriate. 

Appropriate levels of car parking provision vary dramatically depending on the type of development and its location. A key factor appears to be the accessibility of the development’s location. A highly-accessible area tends to be thought of as one that is well-connected to key services via active or public transport, and/or to have a high level of access to emerging transport solutions like car share.

Ensuring appropriate levels of car parking can have significant flow-on effects for the broader community – for example:

•	In low-accessibility areas, appropriate car parking can reduce time taken to find, or queue for, parking; this can also reduce the number and duration of traffic jams.
•	In high-accessibility areas, appropriate car parking can encourage use of active and public transport, and result in reduced levels of car use and ownership.

There is currently no reliable way for accessibility to be measured. So, we are looking for a way to measure accessibility that:

•	Can be defined in legislation
•	Can be easily used by anyone, for any location in NSW
•	Enables the setting of clear thresholds – e.g. if a location satisfies a certain threshold for accessibility, a new development would not be required to provide car parking, or could provide it at a lower rate because the people living there are less likely to need to use or own cars.

A way of visualising this measure of accessibility (for example, via a heat map or similar) would also be highly valued. 

Such a measure would provide land use planners with an evidence base for setting the most appropriate car parking requirements for new development. 

In solving this problem, it might be useful to consider:

•	Where are we already seeing reduced dependency on cars? What factors are influencing this? 
•	Where is dependency on cars still high? What factors are influencing this?

Factors might include things like:

•	How long it takes to get to essential services like shops and schools by active (walking, cycling) or public transport
•	Public transport accessibility:
    o	How many routes are available within a certain distance of each location?
    o	How many services do those routes receive at different times of day? 
    o	Is access direct or are service changes needed?
•	The availability and uptake of novel transport solutions like car share

International,2021,264,Hack for a Circular Economy,"In order to build a more sustainable community, how might we redesign, rethink, repair and repurpose spaces, places, materials, and digital infrastructure, systems and policies within cities in order to progress social, natural and economic development? ","Building a Circular Economy in our communities across Australia & New Zealand is essential to make our cities and regions more sustainable and digital technology will play an important role along this journey.

According to the United Nations 55% of the global population lives in urban areas and is expected to rise to 68% by 2050 (UN DESA, 2020). This density of population has a significant impact on global waste as cities are responsible for consuming 75% of the world’s natural resources. Hence, we need to build cities that are more sustainable and leveraging the approach of a Circular Economy can help address this challenge. We need to redesign, rethink, repair and repurpose the resources that contribute to a very significant i.e., 50% of global waste (Circular Cities, 2020) within our cities.  

Before you begin working on this challenge it’s important to understand “What a Circular Economy is?” The Ellen MacArthur Foundation defines Circular Economy being a systemic approach to economic development designed to benefit businesses, society, and the environment. In contrast to the ‘take-make-waste’ linear model, a circular economy is regenerative by design and aims to gradually decouple growth from the consumption of finite resources. To understand the Circular Economy better you could visit this [page](https://archive.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/explore/the-circular-economy-in-detail). 

While working on this challenge, participants are expected to reimagine the existing systems within cities; including buildings, spaces, mobility and transport systems, among other infrastructure and propose new solutions underpinned by circular economy principles. To make your idea part of the global agenda, consider the [United Nations Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). 

Circular economy principles which aim to eliminate waste have the potential to contribute to more sustainable cities. A system that reduces waste, activates space, and promotes positive social and economic change. As part of this challenge participants are expected to develop solutions that leverage digital technology to bring the idea of a circular economy to life. 

The areas participants would need to evaluate include:

•        Emissions
•        Water 
•        Waste
•        Energy

Australia,2021,255,IoT insights for better regional agribusiness at scale,"How might we harness open data and IoT insights in near-real-time to enable local agribusiness and farms in our regions be more productive and sustainable at scale?

How can we share private IoT data and regional open data for an overall more productive and sustainable agribusiness?
","With the increased prevalence of droughts, natural disasters, harmful pests, and climate change, it has never been more important to innovate for sustainable and resilient farming practices.  Environmentally friendly techniques and technology are the key to meeting the food demand with right nutrition for consumers. 

Using IoT data, design and develop a solution that improves farming practices and increase yield in a sustainable way ( i.e., reducing carbon footprint, leveraging scarce water, minimal pesticide usage) . The solution should empower farmers to make informed and timely decisions on how to grow, manage and sustain farm produce and the environment with minimal effort.

The “Internet of Things” refers to the billions of devices and sensors connected to the internet that can send and receive data. These devices could be smart lights, temperature monitors, water meters, cow trackers, security cameras, tractors, glasses, soil PH monitors, fences, anything you can thing of! Those devices generate an incredible amount of data.  That data may be useful to the owner of the device, AND if combined with other data points it could drive big data insights to our agribusinesses. 

There are many ways for IoT devices can connect to the internet. You could connect them with internet cables, or connect over Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Sigfox, and several other local networks. But arguably the easiest and fastest way to connect to the internet is by putting a SIM in those devices, so it can connect straight to the 3G/4G/5G network without you having to set up cables or configure passwords. This is ‘cellular’ IoT. 

At Telstra, we have 2 incredible cellular IoT technologies that are “Low Power Wide Area Networks” (LPWAN): NB-IoT and Cat-M1. With lower power required to connect, LPWAN IoT devices have a longer battery life. For rural deployments, this means less time spent going out to remote areas for battery changes, and in urban dense areas it means less disruption digging up underground sensors. Cellular IoT also allows rapid deployment, with minimal change to existing infrastructure; no dodgy wi-fi connections or cables, just set and forget!

In agriculture, IoT has been used to understand hyper-local weather rainfall and sunshine levels to help farmers plan harvesting times, or in tracking cattle location and temperature to protect their livestock, or alerting land owners when the water tanks on their remote farm are running dry so they can trigger a water pump to top it up. 

We can use granular data points from the live agriculture systems to visualise and automate these systems in real time, but we can also use historical data from the IoT sensors paired with open data to create long-term changes to the fundamental systems.  

How can we enable agribusiness to use enhance precision farming with minimal water and energy wastage and reduced pesticide application?

How can we give land owners and farmers in agribusiness the insights they need to change the way they produce sustainably?

Don’t limit it to the single farmer, or the single paddock, think big!

","More than a year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the world’s nations are now coming to accept that Covid-19 is not going away. With vaccination rates increasing, the number of hospitalisations and deaths from the virus are beginning to come under control. Plans are beginning to be made to progressively re-open the world.

The Australian National University has collated and normalised Covid management data from across Australia through CRISPER (see below for details on CRISPER).

New South Wales,2021,246,MORE Public Spaces ,"How do we unlock underutilised government owned land and property to create new, high quality public space?","### The Challenge:

This problem statement seeks to find solutions that support our **‘MORE’** public spaces approach, specifically through unlocking underutilised government owned land and property to create new, high quality public space. NSW Government land and property owners are an important partner in achieving the Priority, both through place-based planning, delivery of public space and broader initiatives. There is the potential for under-utilised government land to be activated through ‘meanwhile’ or temporary uses until the property or land is needed for a future planned use, or to be used permanently as public space. Greening Grey infrastructure (storm water and other utilities) can also support this goal. 

Targeting interventions on government land for new public space for areas with lower access is also an opportunity. Concepts of shared use of government land and property are also being explored and trailed. The Department of Education's program ‘Share our Space’ is an excellent example for school grounds. Analysis, and innovative and cost-effective methods to understand where unlocking of land is feasible, will support “more” public space. 

### Background:

Quality green, open and public spaces are important to everyone. They are our free and publicly accessible parks, gardens and sports fields, walkable shady streets, libraries, museums and galleries, which form the heart of our communities. Our public spaces make life more welcoming and accessible. They delight and connect people. They support our health and well-being, environmental resilience and prosperous local economies. They’re at the heart of everyday life.

Public spaces are all places **publicly owned or of public use, accessible and enjoyable by all for free**. They include our **open spaces, public facilities (e.g. libraries, galleries, museums) and streets**. The quality of public space is a combination of its **physical form**, the **activities** that occur in the place and the **meaning** people associate with the place. 

The NSW Premier’s Priority Greener Public Spaces (the Priority) is to *increase the proportion of homes in urban areas within 10 minutes’ walk of quality green, open and public space by 10 percent by 2023*. To monitor the impact of the Priority we measure an increase in homes in urban areas that have improved access within 10 minutes’ walk (800m walking catchment) of a new or improved public space.  

To achieve the Priority, we are taking a “more, better, activated” approach, along with emphasising the resilience of public space as playing a key role in the “road to recovery” from recent disasters and the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

• **MORE:** identifying areas with lower access to public space, the Priority will target strategies that provide access to new quality public spaces in these areas
• BETTER: identifying areas with high access to public space, the Priority will target strategies that improve quality of public spaces in these areas 
• ACTIVATED: in all areas, the Priority will target strategies that increase activation 
• ROAD TO RECOVERY: Since 2019 we have also focused our work on the importance of public spaces in the resilience of communities to disasters such as bushfires, floods and the global COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Evaluation Tool for Public Space and Public Life, is the first resource in the new online Great Public Spaces Toolkit. It is a user-friendly resource that allows anyone to assess the quality of public spaces, its positive attributes, as well as areas for improvement. The NSW Public Spaces Charter is another key resource. The Charter, currently in draft form, can be used to guide planning, design, management and activation of public space. The Charter will be a resource for individuals, organisations and agencies responsible for public space.

Australia,2021,263,Reimagining Digital Government Services,"How can we re-imagine digital government services in Australia to enable a seamless experience for people of all abilities.
","The rapid digitalisation in the last 18-months due to the global health crisis has required the government to enable digital government services to extend important services to citizens.  

The global health crisis has seen people gravitate towards digital government services whether by necessity or choice. Citizens expect the government to enable best in class digital government services for people of all abilities. It’s important for these services to be accessible, responsive, transparent, secure, and importantly connected, enabling a seamless experience.  

While working on this challenge, participants are expected to reimagine digital government services and how these could be better made available to citizens by seamlessly integrating services that support people’s needs across life events. Participants will need to think of ideas to deliver digital government services that are simple and personalised across multiple agencies. 

The solutions will need to look at accessibility, responsiveness, security, privacy, transparency, and importantly enable a unified experience. For instance, a seamless experience would entail that the system pre-fills and submits your forms when you request it, pre-assesses your eligibility, and makes automatic payments. All this by enabling secure exchange of data and protecting privacy. 

The solution needs to look at connecting government services behind the scenes and offer the consumer a seamless way to get what they need and when they need it.

New South Wales,2021,245,ROAD TO RECOVERY Public Spaces,"How do we build confidence in the community to use public spaces to support economic, social, cultural and environmental recovery, whether in response to Covid-19, or other disasters such as recent bushfires and floods?
","### The Challenge:

This problem statement seeks to find solutions that support our **‘ROAD TO RECOVERY’** public spaces approach. We are interested in understanding how we better utilise public spaces as an enabler for community resilience, and economic, social, cultural and environmental recovery.

In late 2019 record-breaking temperatures and months of drought fuelled a series of bushfires that in NSW affected more than five million hectares of the State. In March 2021 floods across NSW saw communities evacuated, with extensive damage to homes, infrastructure, as well as natural environments and public space. And, in early 2020 the COVID-19 pandemic meant we were not able to leave our homes apart from essential reasons for extended periods, with ongoing outbreaks disrupting the way of life for so many. 

What we have also seen around the world is, a heightened awareness of the value of public space for community resilience. Public spaces are helping people to stay healthy and physically distanced in their local communities. They play a critical role in supporting local businesses and economies, and disaster-affected communities, to bounce back; and in fostering a renewed sense of belonging and place attachment. 

### Background:

They are our free and publicly accessible parks, gardens and sports fields, walkable shady streets, libraries, museums and galleries, which form the heart of our communities.

New Zealand,2021,274,Solar Panel AI: How can we encourage citizens and businesses to move to cleaner energy?,"The goal is to identify and segment all the building roofs of a city and identify which way they are facing (a roof could be segmented by identifying the ridgeline). This information could be later on stored into a GIS and be queried to filter all the roofs facing a certain orientation to the sun. It is important that we optimize sun exposure for north facing roofs. This information will help energy companies, councils and others to identify where solar panels could be installed and evaluate the potential in the city.
","How can we encourage citizens and businesses to move to cleaner energy?

Councils want to work with residents and business owners to look at areas to activate where solar can be of benefit. It is especially important to cross-reference this against social-economic data, so the best roofs fit the people most in need, for subsidising, etc. The council wants the city to have energy independence and also consume clean energy, eg. help people move off wood burners.

Council and the public thus have this open data, together working to a solution.

How can we encourage citizens and businesses to move to solar?


### Additional Information:

Below are examples of how you might wish to approach this challenge. Please use this as an example only and not as guidance.

**For example:**

ONE - Provide a city manager’s city-wide dashboard for the area potential of all north facing roofs:

• Cross-reference the dashboard with lower socioeconomic areas of the city
• Make the direction an adjustable parameter +/- North (the sun is not perfectly aligned with North)

TWO - Provide a citizen interface to take their home address and analyze their roof to indicate their north facing area and if they are available for subsidy (in lower socioeconomic area)

• Provide a mock contact to ECan submission form with their details to look at different options for a subsidised solar scheme

THREE - Exclude any roofs already that have solar installed

FOUR - Identify any roofs with a chimney installed

**Tools**

The technical stuff.

You have the choice of using the Trimble AI / Machine Learning tools to help solve this challenge! Everything you need to analyse a roof image, what pixel is what for the neutral network and training engine.

In our cities, the current model is that charges for water usage and the provision of water is charged equally to residential properties. It doesn’t take into account factors such as the number of people living in a property, what the water is being used for, or any other factors around how, when, and where that water is being used.
